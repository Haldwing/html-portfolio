<h1>The best movies according to Hilding</h1>

<h2>My five favourite movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Mean Streets</h3><p>One of my absolute favourite Scorsese movies. The low budget production almost seems to emphasize the grit and passion that the movie seems to be bursting with. Great performances by Keitel and De Niro, and a great rock and roll soundtrack</p>
<h3>Breaking Away</h3><p>This is the coming of age film to rule them all. By the same director who made Bullitt, suprisingly, we get this movie about a young boy who wants to be a professional biker so bad he speaks with an italian accent, since he thinks it will help him emulate his italian bicycling idols better.</p>
<h3>White</h3><p>This movie, which is second in the decalogue, by Krzysztof Kieslowski, is a great and hilarious film. With the start of the movie with a great ice queen turn by Julie Delpy, who plays Dominique and Zbigniew Zamachowski who plays Karol, the main character who is exposed to every misfortune imaginable.</p>
<h3>Y t√∫ Mama Tambien</h3><p>This is a fantastic and morbid film. With a dead eyed narration, it lets us follow two boys embark on a road trip, invite an alluring older woman along, who against all odds and assumptions, agrees to come along, and a sexual triangle emerges. All of the silliness is interspersed by recountings by the narrator of deadly accidents and misfortune brewing under the surface of the places they go past.</p>
<h3>Fellowship of the Ring</h3><p>When I was a kid, I got to read the books first, since my brother gifted me with them. I had read all three as a 10-year old and I had to argue with my parents, that I should be allowed to see the movie, despite their religious misgivings. What followed completely knocked me out, I could not believe how well they had recreated it, it was just as I imagined and more.</p>
