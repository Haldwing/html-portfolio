<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hilding Karlsson. I have just embarked on a journey to learn web development. This page is the first example of the rudimentary skills I have acquired. 
I have been a musician for over a decade. I make music where I play almost all instruments, to make songs that i sing, that tell stories and emotions, making life out to be a bit richer than it seems at times.

<p>As time goes on, you will find more projects, and music linked to from the page. If you find this early, please stay tuned to see it all develop.</p>
